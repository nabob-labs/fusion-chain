/// Stub: to be replaced with impls of cnidarium_component::ActionHandler
///
/// This trait should move to that crate, but the orphan rules make it tricky to
/// move it before we finish splitting all the crates: if we move the trait now,
/// existing impls in this crate on foreign types will all break. But without
/// moving it, we can't start splitting up the crate at all.  Solution:
/// duplicate the trait here and there, and provide a generic impl of this trait
/// for anything implementing the copy of the trait in the other crate.  Later,
/// we can delete this trait entirely.
///
/// Currently, there are only three impls, all of which are entangled with app-level data:
///
/// - ProposalSubmit (which is entangled with the whole-application state)
/// - Action (which needs to slot in the FusionHost for IBC action handling)
/// - Transaction (which depends on the above)
