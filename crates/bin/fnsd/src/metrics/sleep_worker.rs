//! A sleep worker.
//!
//! ### Overview
//!
//! This submodule defines a metric, and an accompanying worker task, for use in measuring
//! scheduler latency in the tokio runtime. This worker will repeatedly sleep for one second, and
//! then observe the amount of time it *actually* spent waiting to be woken up. This is useful for
//! detecting when the asynchronous runtime is being disrupted by blocking I/O, or other expensive
//! non-coÃ¶perative computation.
//!
//! Use [`register_metrics()`] to register the [`SLEEP_DRIFT`] metric with an exporter, and spawn
//! the worker onto a runtime by calling [`run()`].
